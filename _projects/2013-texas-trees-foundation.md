The Texas Trees Foundation sought support on a spatial analysis project that would provide a framework for urban tree planting and would be included in the State of the Urban Forest – Dallas 2013 report.  The Texas Trees Foundation’s goal was to protect, manage and replant the urban forest to reach a canopy of 40% in South Dallas and create a spatial guide for the Texas Trees Foundation’s planting project of 25,000 trees in one year and other future tree-planting projects.

Julia created a series of maps, charts and tables that sought to:

- Identify high pressure development areas, such as underdeveloped land, vacant land, TIF zones
- Highlight endangered canopy loss
- Identify high priority preservation areas

She also performed an ecological and environmental cost-benefit analysis that considered the costs to developers and the environment of removing trees. This analysis also presented the benefits of planting trees for both small and large scale projects. Lastly, she prioritized planting locations in the Foundation’s Planting Sites geodatabase based on the results of the cost-benefit analysis.

Results of this study were included in the the State of the Urban Forest – Dallas 2013 report to inform city officials and corporate sponsors about the economic returns of investing in urban forestry initiatives, and encourage the policy-makers to set a new baseline percent-UTC coverage goal for the City, specifically South Dallas, where there is the most potential for growth.
